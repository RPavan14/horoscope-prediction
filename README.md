Astrology Birth Chart Calculator
Overview
The Astrology Birth Chart Calculator is a Python-based application designed to construct and analyze astrological birth charts. This program uses the flatlib library to calculate the positions of celestial bodies and determine their corresponding Nakshatras (lunar mansions) and zodiac signs. The application provides detailed insights into the user’s astrological profile by calculating the positions and Nakshatras of the Moon, Sun, Ascendant, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu. It also determines the house lords and presents a comprehensive astrological report.

How It Works
The tool takes a list of dates as input and identifies occurrences where Saturn appears. It then analyzes these dates to find overlapping occurrences of Saturn. The more overlap there is among the dates, the stronger the prediction according to astrological interpretations.

Usage
To use the tool:

Input a list of dates.
Run the program to analyze and calculate Saturn overlaps.
Review the output to identify dates with stronger Saturn predictions based on overlap.
